      Hello my love I am writing this off the cuff but I wanted to send you a message for your birthday. I’ve stayed up until 12:00 to write this hopefully but I just lied that it was some stupid ass report LOL. I know you prefer letters that are written down and heartfelt but I figured with the circumstances I would write something that I could give you now.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want you to know, my love, that you are the most perfect woman in the whole entire world. You push me to be my best self and I want nothing more than to watch you succeed and be your best self as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to be here and help you when you are down. I want to smile with you, to laugh with you, to cry with you, and to be nothing with you and just spend as much time as we can just being together. I want to live with you and I want to grow with you and I want to go through all the stages of my life with you. There’s nothing more than that in life that I want.

      Your voice is like music to me. Seeing you smile is like seeing the best art in the whole entire world. Nothing could match your beauty, not any great work in history nor any view the beauty of the world could conjure up. You are so beautiful from every angle at every time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know, my love, that there are a lot of stresses in life. But you are so strong and you persist through anything. I couldn’t imagine another person in the world who would match your tenacity, match your determination to push through it all even when you feel like the whole world is pushing back against you. You are perfect.
